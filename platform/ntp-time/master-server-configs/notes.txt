The master servers are ns4 and ns5

They are configured differently from the rest of the servers, which run a cron script.  The primary servers must run the time servers as a service to take advantage of the /etc/ntp.conf and which server ranges to allow.

# To check if the servers are set up properly
cd /etc/init.d
chkconfig --list ntpd

# To turn on the service do the following
chkconfig --levels 345 ntpd on


# Be sure to use the ntp.conf file found here
